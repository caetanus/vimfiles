Welcome to my vim files.
=======================

I most use this files to python editing.

to take full advantage of this, make sure that exuberant-ctags are instaled.

commands:
---------

### completion

ctrl-x-o -> to complete any function showing documentation of your python library
ctrl-n -> complete any phrase typed before in some buffer.

### tabs
ctrl-t -> creates a new tab
ctrl-w -> closes current tab
ctrl-pgup -> navigates to the next tab
ctrl-pgdwn -> navigates to the previous tab

## copy and paste
shift-insert -> makes a paste
shitf-delete -> makes a cut
ctrl-insert -> makes a copy

## line-endings
ctrl-f7 -> converts dos to unix line ending.


## xml facilities
if you have xmllint instaled, any xml file will be indented when oppened.

\sw <left> -> creates a split to left (the same to the others navigation keys)
\s <left> -> moves to the split at left (the same to the others navigation keys)
